# Simple Digital Solution Marketplace
This was based off of Ryan Morris, Zachary Babcock, and Taylor Holtzs' Android Application.

Simple Digital Solution Marketplace was a mimic to the 'Google Play' store.

This will go over the basics of what the applications functionality is doing.
+ We've got the Android Application built in Android Studio 1.2 (Canary).

+ We've got a website that compliments that data that is kept on a SQL Server Database.

+ We've got a Web Service written in C# bridging the Application to the SQL Server Database.
 - This bridge grabs and sends JSON Objects to and from.
 
+ The website itself, will store High Scores and other personal data from the Games and Utilities portion of the Application.
